Optional Web Calculator Tool 2018 Revision (Version 1.0) to:Technical Guidance For Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing
NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-OPR-59

### Introduction
NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) recognizes that the permanent threshold shift (PTS) onset thresholds and marine mammal auditory weighting functions provided in the 2018 Revised Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing are more complex than NMFS' previous thresholds and that different action proponents may have different levels of modeling capabilities. Thus, NMFS has provided a companion optional Web Calculator tool for those action proponents unable to implement the 2018 Revised Technical Guidance's thresholds in the weighted cumulative sound exposure level (SEL<sub>cum</sub>) and peak sound pressure (PK) level metrics and the associated marine mammal auditory weighting functions.

There is _no_ obligation to use the optional Web Calculator tool. The use of more sophisticated exposure modeling or consideration of additional activity‐, source-, or location‐specific factors, if possible, is encouraged.

### Using the Optional Web Calculator Tool
The optional Web Calculator Tool consists of four main Tabs provided as a ribbon at the top of this and all tabs:

**Introduction**: 
Current Tab that provides a general introduction to the optional Web Calculator tool.

**Optional Calculator**: 
Tab where action proponent enters project and source information to compute threshold isopleths (meters)

**Weight Factor Adjustments (WFA)**: 
Tab that provides more information on using Weighting Factor Adjustments (WFA) used to incorporate weighting functions* in to isopleth calculations.

**Glossary and Literature Cited**: 
Tab that provides a list of abbreviations and glossary terms found in the optional Web Calculator Tool. It also provides a list of literature cited.

*WFAs consider marine mammal auditory weighting functions by focusing on a single frequency for those who cannot fully apply auditory weighting functions associated with the SEL<sub>cum</sub> metric thresholds.*

NMFS also provides a User Manual for the optional Web Calculator Tool (see links below).

### Note
This Web Calculator provides a means to estimates distances associated with the Technical Guidance's PTS onset thresholds. Mitigation and monitoring requirements associated with a Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) authorization or an Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation or permit are independent management decisions made in the context of the proposed activity and comprehensive effects analysis, and are beyond the scope of the Technical Guidance and the Web Calculator."

### Disclaimer
NMFS has provided this Web Calculator as an optional tool to provide estimated effect distances (i.e., isopleths) where PTS onset thresholds may be exceeded. Results provided by this calculator do not represent the entirety of the comprehensive effects analysis, but rather serve as one tool to help evaluate the effects of a proposed action on marine mammal hearing and make findings required by NOAA's various statutes. Input values are the responsibility of the individual user.
